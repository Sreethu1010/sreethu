                for being home to the oldest shipyard in all of India. Located a short distance away from 
                Visakhapatnam is Araku Valley, one of the prime attractions of Vizag. Situated at a lofty 910 
                metres above sea level, Araku Valley is a hill station replete with gushing waterfalls, crystal

                hills on three sides, and by the Bay of Bengal on the other side. One of the best things about Vizag’s 
                beaches is that they are a lot cleaner and a lot less crowded than other famous beaches along the Indian 
                coastline, and Yarada beach is no exception. It is the perfect place to sit back on the golden sands and 
                witness a marvellous sunrise or sunset.</p>
